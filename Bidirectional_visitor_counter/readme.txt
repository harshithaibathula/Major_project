In todayâ€™s world there is a continuous need for automated appliances, with the increase in the living
standard, there is an immediate need for developing circuit that would change the complexity of life
to simplicity. The model is designed in order to count the visitors of an offices, auditoriums, hall,
sport venue. When a person enters the room, count would be increased, whereas on leaving, the count
would decrease. This count will be very accurate and it will beep a warning alarm if the number of
people exceeds the limit. The aggregate number of people will appear on the LCD. In the circuit
an Arduino UNO Board is utilized. This will help in the accurate measurement of the visitors and
is less complex compared to a microcontroller. The Arduino will get signals from the sensors and
those signals work under the control of a programming code which is put away in the ROM of the
Arduino. The Infrared Receivers will continuously monitor any entity which passes both outside the
building and inside the building. According to the number of guests inside the industry, electronic
appliances like lights, fans and coolers will be triggered on and off. This automation will save lots of
electricity. There will also be a temperature and humidity sensor which will detect the temperature of
an industry. If the temperature exceeds for any reason the circuit will beep, a warning alarm.
